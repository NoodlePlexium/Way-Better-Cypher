# Way-Better-Cypher
An advanced cycpher, with a stronger encryption algorithm.

The algorithm starts with an alphabet of letterns numbers and symbols. 
This alphabet is shuffled according to a random seed.
The Seed is created by the "Code" that the user inputs.

To encrypt, the user types in a message, then they type in a code. The Algorithm outputs a scrambled message.

When a user wishes to decrypt the scrambled message, they have to input the scrambled 
message as well as the correct code.
